    <h3>list of things I watch my girlfriend eat during her lunchbreak</h3>
    <p>Hopefully this list is not giving away too much about her location but boy does she love to eat these on her lunchbreak</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.chipotle.com/" target="_blank">Chipotle rice and chicken</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://gillsfriedchickentx.com/" target="_blank">Gills chicken sandwich</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://global.zaxbys.com/welcome.html" target="_blank">Zaxbys Cheese fries</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.in-n-out.com/menu#hamburger" target="_blank">In and Out</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://whataburger.com/home" target="_blank">whataburger</a>
    </ul>
    <p>Now I'm not going to say I don't enjoy watching her eat but she tends to eat the same thing a week in a row</p>
