    <h5>For the purpose of learning and demonstration</h5>

    <h3>list of things I watch my girlfriend eat during her lunchbreak</h3>
    <p>Hopefully this list is not giving away too much about her location but boy does she love to eat these on her lunchbreak</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.chipotle.com/" target="_blank"><img src="./img/burri.jpeg" alt="she usually picks chicken though" width="200" height="200"></a></li>
        
        <li><a href="https://gillsfriedchickentx.com/" target="_blank"><img src="./img/gill.jpg" alt="she ate all the fries" width="200" height="200"></a></li>
        
        <li><a href="https://global.zaxbys.com/welcome.html" target="_blank"><img src="./img/zaxbysfries.jpg" alt="remember to replace" width="200" height="200"></a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now I'm not going to say I don't enjoy watching her eat but she tends to eat the same thing a week in a row</p>
